### to improve

- from the security perspective - storing credentials in github => should be passed via environment 
- model mapper is slow, learn how to use mapStruct
- exceptions in `ExceptionUtil.java` can be constant, not functions
- better naming `getAccessToken` actuall should be something like `makeAccessToken` or `create...`
