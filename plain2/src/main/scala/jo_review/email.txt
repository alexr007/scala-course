Hello!
I have finished a review of your book.
Firstly, I want to say thanks for allowing me to review that book. 
Secondly, knowing you more than five years, having read all of your books, being an active reader of your blog,
being mostly agree with your vision and approaches,
it was a big surprise to me that you decided to explain OOP in terms of Java Scrips.On the other hand,
JS perfectly fits in your concept, because it gives your ability to create classes without keyword new,
but by using functions.Also, I want to say, that book is not just OOP for juniors,
it is a kind of book that should be on the table to explain very serious things in a very relaxed manner.
You have managed to teach almost all SDLC stages easy and simple at the same moment. Definitely, because of your experience.
It covers all significant stages, not only coding but also everything is related to it.
I attached the PDF of the book with marks (yellow and red).
They are mostly typos; there is no difference between the red and yellow ones.

I also attach the text file with notes you can take into consideration.
I haven't dived deeply into the JS code provided, but I have cloned the repo. It works. And it is cool.
It is extremely good that you have different tags to let the reader switch between them and see incremental changes.

Thanks!
My Best wishes!
