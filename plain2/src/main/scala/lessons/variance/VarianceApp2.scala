    * If we would like a Cat => SmallAnimal (because cats eat small animals),
    * but are given a Animal => Mouse instead, our program will still work.
    *
    * Intuitively an Animal => Mouse will still accept a Cat as an argument,
    * because a Cat is an Animal, and it returns a Mouse, which is also a SmallAnimal.
    *
    * Since we can safely and invisibly substitute the former by the latter,
    * we can say Animal => Mouse is a subtype of Cat => SmallAnimal.
